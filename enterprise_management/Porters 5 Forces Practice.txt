Electrical Vehicles Porters 5 Forces Essay Practice


The porters five forces are:
        Threat of new entrants
        Threat of substitutes
        Bargaining power of suppliers
        Bargaining power of buyers
        Competitive rivalry


Porters five forces measure the micro economic challenges to a potential new venture




At the moment in the electric vehicle industry, buyers have most of the bargaining power. This is because there is an abundance of suppliers for EVs, nearly every combustion engine car manufacturer also has an EV or hybrid line available. As well as this there are many sol EV companies like Tesla or Polestar. This means buyers have lots of choice and we can be easily outpriced as a new company. As well as this the cost of switching supplier is quite low, due to government EV leasing benefits it can be easy to swap the car being leased. Therefore new entrants into the EV market need to ensure they show a clear differentiation and have good brand development to avoid the buyers power taking effect. For example, think of a new look for EVs that hasn’t been seen before, or add innovative features that would appeal to the market.


The threat of substitutes however is positive for new entrants. As EVs are a new advancement in transport the generic substitutions are less likely. Everyone needs vehicles, specifically in areas with poor transport links. This implies that very few people would replace buying a car with say building a new kitchen. As well as this the product for product substitution is low risk, especially due to the environmental and government pressure on using EVs. This means people are less likely to swap their EV for a combustion vehicle. Despite this, one risk is the substitution for public transport or man powered transport like bicycles. But overall, the substitution of need for a car is very unlikely for most families throughout the nation. Therefore the threat of substitution is low and we don’t need to concern ourselves with researching this field.


Competitive rivalry is a big issue in the EV industry. There are established brands like Tesla who have market share, with things such as their state of the art charging grid and brand loyalty. This makes it hard to enter since incumbent firms benefit from economies of scale, and better research and development capabilities. As a result it is more difficult for new entrants to compete on price or match the level of service these firms can. As well as this the EV market is rapidly advancing and developments in charging speeds, battery capacities or motor performance are hard to keep ahead of, especially as a newly established firm,. Therefore the competitive rivalry will be a big challenge for any new entrants into the EV market.


The threat of new entrants is relatively low. The growing demand and incentives for EV corportations is attractive, but the high capital requirements are a major entry barrier. Large investment is needed for the research and development, manufacturing processes and compliance teams. In addition strong brand loyalty to existing manufacturers is also hard to beat. Many combustion vehicle providers are also yet to bring out EV ranges, which when they do so has a much easier barrier than for completely new entrants. Therefore, while entry is possible, it is extremely difficult to sustain longitudinal success.


In EV production, suppliers have moderate to high bargaining power. Key components such as lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, and rare earth materials are essential for vehicle production and are often sourced from a limited number of suppliers. This concentration gives suppliers greater leverage over pricing and availability, particularly as global demand for EVs continues to rise. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical factors can further increase supplier power. While larger manufacturers may reduce this power through long-term contracts or vertical integration, new entrants are less able to do so, making them more vulnerable to cost increases. Therefore, supplier power represents a significant challenge for new EV ventures.
